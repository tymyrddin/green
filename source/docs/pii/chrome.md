# How to stop Chrome from tracking your interests (Disable Topics API)

Google’s Topics API is a feature in Chrome that tracks your browsing habits to show "relevant" ads. Instead of 
tracking you across websites with cookies, it assigns you interest categories (like "Fitness" or "Travel") based on 
what you visit.

Here’s how to disable it—and why you might want to switch to a more private browser.

## Turn off topics in chrome

Open Chrome and type in the address bar `chrome://settings/privacy`

Scroll down to "Ad privacy" (or search for it) and disable all three options:

* "Ad Topics" (stops interest-based tracking)
* "Site-suggested ads" (blocks sites from recommending ads)
* "Ad measurement" (prevents tracking ad clicks)

Note: Google may still collect some data, but this reduces how much is used for ads.

### Why disabling topics API isn’t enough

Even with these settings off, Chrome still:

* Tracks your IP address
* Keeps browser fingerprinting active
* Shares data with Google for "analytics"

For stronger privacy, consider switching browsers.

## Switch to a privacy-focused browser

Best Alternatives to Chrome:

***Firefox + Privacy settings***

* Blocks trackers by default
* Supports extensions like uBlock Origin (best ad blocker)
* Enable "Strict" tracking protection in settings

***Brave***

* Built-in ad & tracker blocker
* Uses Tor in Private Tabs for extra anonymity
* Pays you in crypto (optional) for viewing privacy-respecting ads

***Tor browser***

* The most private option (routes traffic through multiple servers)
* Blocks fingerprinting completely
* Slower, but ideal for sensitive browsing

## Lock down your browser (extra protection)

Even if you stick with Chrome, improve privacy by:

* Going to `chrome://settings/cookies` → Block third-party cookies
* [Installing Privacy Badger (blocks hidden trackers)](blocks.md)
