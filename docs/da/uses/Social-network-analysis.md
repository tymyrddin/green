# Social network analysis

Social network analysis is a quantitative and qualitative process that measures the flow of relationship in a social network. The relationship is represented in the form of nodes and links where nodes represent the people and links represent the relationships between the nodes.

For example, it can identify which users are most influential over others inside the social networks and can be used for predictive analysis.
