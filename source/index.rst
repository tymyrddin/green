Green Team
=========================================

The green team focuses on the larger environment, both technical and human, on documenting what happens and understanding the unseen logic of the forest, bottom-up and top-down, with intent of creating human-readable writeups for improving communication, lowering thresholds for participation, and providing people with well-understood choices.

The threat landscape for people in the public and private sector has changed enormously over the past decade. Physical threats have decreased while digital security threats have increased.
