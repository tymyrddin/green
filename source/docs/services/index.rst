Demystifying the craft
===========================

Ty Myrddin workshops and facilitated processes offer a journey into the practical art of security. Designed for
individual practitioners and small organisations, these choreographies use role-playing, hands-on labs, and custom
games to transform abstract knowledge into applied skill. Learn to think like an adversary, defend like a sentinel,
and demystify the tools and tactics that define the landscape.
