# Black markets

Black markets are considered to be among the most likely adversaries to broker re-identified data and the knowledge and tools on how to re-identify data, in order to make money.

## Motivation

Financial gain. Personally identifiable information gotten illegally from de-anonymisation techniques is sold in underground marketplaces, which are also a form of anonymisation platforms. 

## Impact

Information that falls into the wrong hands can be used for further hacking, coercion, extortion, and intimidation leading to privacy concerns and enormous costs for individuals and organisations who fall victim.
