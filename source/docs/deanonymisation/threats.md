## Identity disclosure

Identity disclosure refers to deanonymising a user identity. 

## Content disclosure

Content disclosure refers to revealing any anonymised sensitive personal data – including “special categories” of data relating to racial or ethnic origin, political opinion, sexuality, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, health or genetic data, or criminal convictions, and other sensitive data such as identity documents or financial data. 

## Link disclosure

Link disclosure refers to deanonymising relationships between users, which can eventually lead to identity disclosure.

## New form of consent

The Internet is not moral or immoral, it reflects what we ask from it. Marketers will pay more for consumers than consumers will pay for content. People avoid paywalls, and do not sufficiently protect themselves from cookies and trackers. Apparently, having our personal data used for being advertised to is our preferred method of payment for internet services.

We seem to have a new standard for consent. When we go on a website, when we visit it, we are giving the adversaries permission to take any information they want?
