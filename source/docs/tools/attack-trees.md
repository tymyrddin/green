# Modelling Attack trees

Commercial Tools like SecurITree, AttackTree+ and opensource tools like ADTool, Ent, SeaMonster are used to model 
[attack trees](../methods/attack-trees.md).

And since this is just about drawing boxes, and drawing tool will do. Also, writing the tree is very common and 
will suffice. See examples of that [here](https://tymyrddin.github.io/attack-trees/).
