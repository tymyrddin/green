# VPNs for privacy protection

A Virtual Private Network (VPN) is one of the most effective tools for safeguarding your online privacy. It encrypts your internet traffic, hides your IP address, and helps you bypass censorship—but not all VPNs are equal.

## Why you need a VPN

* Hide Your IP Address – Prevents websites, ISPs, and governments from tracking your real location.
* Encrypt Your Traffic – Secures your data on public Wi-Fi (airports, cafes, hotels).
* Bypass Censorship & Geo-Blocks – Access restricted content (news, streaming, social media).
* Stop ISP Snooping – Prevents your internet provider from selling your browsing history.

## Free VPNs: The risks

* Log and sell your data (Hola VPN, Turbo VPN)
* Slow speeds & ads (most free tiers)
* Weak encryption (some leak your IP)

Only trustworthy free option: Proton VPN Free (no logs, no speed limits).

## How to set up a VPN (Step-by-Step)

1. Choose a VPN (Proton, Mullvad, or IVPN recommended).
2. Download & Install (from official website, not app stores).
3. Enable Kill Switch (stops internet if VPN disconnects).
4. Use WireGuard/OpenVPN (faster & more secure than older protocols).

Test for Leaks ([ipleak.net](https://ipleak.net/)).

## When a VPN will not protect You

* Against malware (use an antivirus + firewall).
* From Google/Facebook tracking (use privacy browsers + cookies blockers).
* If you log into accounts (VPNs hide IPs, not identities).

## Privacy tips

* Use Tor + VPN (chaining VPN through Tor) for maximum anonymity (but slower speeds).
* Avoid US-based VPNs (subject to surveillance laws).
* Check audits (look for "no-logs" confirmation from independent firms).

## Recommendation

* For best privacy: Proton VPN or Mullvad.
* For speed + streaming: NordVPN (but prioritize privacy-first options).

A VPN is just one layer—combine it with [Firefox + uBlock Origin](blocks.md) + [encrypted email](email.md) for full protection.
