# Quantum-enabled retrospective deanonymisation

Encrypted data harvested today (e.g., health records, emails) could be decrypted later using quantum computers.

## Protections

* [Adopt quantum-resistant encryption (Signal’s PQXDH, ProtonMail’s post-quantum PGP)](../pii/quantum.md).
* Minimize long-term data storage (delete old emails/files).
