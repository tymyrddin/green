# Trail re-identification

The trail re-identification approach ([Trail Re-Identification:Learning Who You Are From Where You Have Been, Bradley Malin et al., 2013](https://dataprivacylab.org/dataprivacy/projects/trails/paper3.pdf)) was developed for linking genomic data to their identified users whose records are publicly available in various databases.

The concept of trail re-identification includes de-anonymising users by collecting network data and then mapping their anonymised traces with IP addresses, matching IP addresses with Tor hidden services using traffic analysis [Trawling for Tor Hidden Services: Detection, Measurement, Deanonymization, Alex Biryukov, Ivan Pustogarov, Ralf-Philipp Weinmann, 2013](https://www.ieee-security.org/TC/SP2013/papers/4977a080.pdf), and tracking users by detecting their fingerprints in web browsers (visited web pages in the browserâ€™s history).
