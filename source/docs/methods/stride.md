# STRIDE

STRIDE is a methodology developed by Microsoft for threat modelling. It provides a mnemonic for security threats in six categories: 

* Spoofing: An adversary posing as another user, component, or another system that has an identity in the system being modelled.
* Tampering: The modification of data within the system to achieve a malicious goal.
* Repudiation: The ability of an adversary to deny performing some malicious activity in absence of sufficient proof.
* Information Disclosure: The exposure of protected data to a user that is not otherwise allowed access to that data.
* Denial of Service: Occurs when an adversary uses illegitimate means to assume a trust level higher than he/she currently has with different privileges.
* Elevation of Privilege: This threat occurs when an attacker successfully breaches the administrative controls of a system and tampers its configured permissions and privileges. By this, attackers can reach from low-level systems in the network to systems of higher authority, which contains confidential information.
