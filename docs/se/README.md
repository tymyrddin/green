# Search Engine threat model

(Attacker-centric) organising thoughts and connections on two targets which are intertwined as many of the blackhat SEO techniques can 
also be used to fool users for more nefarious purposes: Security and privacy and threats to searchers (users of a 
search engine), hence search engines themselves are also listed as adversary; and search rank spam and fraud threats to 
search engines and their users.
