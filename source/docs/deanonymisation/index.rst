The garden layout: Threat model
===================================

Using attacker-based threat modelling with a quite non-trivial adversary, namely an entire ecosystem of players and 
an often forgotten target, the individual citizen.

De-anonymisation is a strategy in data mining in which anonymous data is cross-referenced with other sources of data 
to re-identify the anonymous data source, often used by those that do not have users' best interest in mind. 
De-anonymisation ***also*** works to further help improve anonymisation techniques and reduce privacy breach by 
probing the potential drawbacks of anonymisation techniques.
