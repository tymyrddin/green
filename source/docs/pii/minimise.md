# Minimise long-term data storage

Think of data like fertiliser: helpful in the right context, but if you pile it up in a forgotten corner of the shed, 
it’ll rot, leak, and [attract raccoons](https://red.tymyrddin.dev/docs/through/). (Or hackers. Same energy.)

Most of us hoard digital information. Old emails, half-written documents, awkward screenshots, years of chat logs — 
all lounging about like digital cobwebs. But here’s the problem: the longer data lingers, the greater the risk it’ll 
one day be stolen, leaked, subpoenaed, or [decrypted by quantum computers that don’t exist yet](../state/quantum.md).

Reducing your long-term data footprint doesn’t just reduce risk — it also clears out digital clutter that nobody, 
including future-you, wants to deal with.

A few strategies for responsible composting:

* Delete old emails and files regularly. Especially the sensitive ones. If you don’t need it, bin it. If you’re sentimental, export it to a document and protect that — don’t leave 3,000 unlabelled emails dangling in your inbox like ivy from the ceiling.
* Use cold storage for keepers. If you must retain sensitive files (e.g., legal documents, creative work, ancient tax returns), put them on a physically isolated storage device — a "gapped" disk that's not connected to the internet. Encrypt it. Label it. Store it somewhere boring.
* Avoid “cloud hoarding.” If it’s in your cloud account, assume it’s in someone else’s data lake too. Even deleted files often stick around longer than you'd expect.
* Be wary of auto-sync. Devices love to replicate data everywhere by default. Turn off syncing for sensitive folders unless you like your private stuff moonlighting on half a dozen insecure endpoints.
* Digital composting: because not everything needs to live forever in your inbox.
