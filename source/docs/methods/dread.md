# DREAD 

DREAD was proposed for threat modelling but dropped by Microsoft in 2008. It is currently used by OpenStack and many 
other corporations. It provides a mnemonic for risk rating security threats using five categories: 

* Damage Potential: ranks the extent of damage that would occur if a vulnerability is exploited.
* Reproducibility: ranks how easy it is to reproduce an attack
* Exploitability: Assigns a number to the effort required to launch the attack.
* Affected Users: A value characterizing how many people will be impacted if an exploit becomes widely available.
* Discoverability: Measures the likelihood of how easy it is to discover the threat.
