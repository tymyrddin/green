# Introduction

## What?

Using attacker-based threat modelling with a quite non-trivial adversary, namely an entire ecosystem of players and an often forgotten target, the individual citizen.

## Why?

De-anonymisation is a strategy in data mining in which anonymous data is cross-referenced with other sources of data to re-identify the anonymous data source, often used by those that do not have users' best interest in mind. De-anonymisation ***also*** works to further help improve anonymisation techniques and reduce privacy breach by probing the potential drawbacks of anonymisation techniques.
