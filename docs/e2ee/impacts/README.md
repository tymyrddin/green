# Impacts

E2EE presents tensions between our right to privacy as humans, and our right to a safe and secure society.

Governments increasingly argue against E2EE making cases on national security grounds and that E2EE inhibits law 
enforcement’s ability to gather data that could lead to the protection of vulnerable individuals. Explicitly mentioned 
are protecting children from harmful content online and how difficult it is to prevent the access to, and distribution 
of, extremist material.

Charity groups call for end-to-end encryption existing in a limited capacity, and that decisions to use it must be 
weighed against any potential risk of harm to the more vulnerable part of society. Sadly, those willing to do that, are 
not the ones we need protection from.

Interpol has expressed support for the dismantling of E2EE across communication services, but apparently [put off (at least temporarily) plans 
to condemn the spread of strong encryption](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-interpol-encryption-idUSKBN1Y12EK) after 
objections by tech companies and civil liberties advocates.

The UK's GCHQ has also argued against the use of E2EE, and has also claimed that technology companies could 
“relatively easily” add a third participant to an encrypted channel between two users, without also adding in a security 
vulnerability.
