# The Greenhouse of Home Privacy

Just like a greenhouse needs care, attention, and smart organisation to grow healthy plants, your digital life at home thrives when tended carefully. These processes are easy to implement at home and nearly all use everyday items. Think of them as seeds—pick one, try it out, and watch your privacy grow.

## Mapping the garden before pruning

*(Personal Data Inventory)*

* What it is: A regular check-up of all your online accounts, apps, and devices. Record what personal information is stored, who it is shared with, and what security settings are active.
* Why it matters: Knowing what you have planted in your garden allows you to spot overgrowth or weak spots before trouble arises.
* Props: Pen and paper, spreadsheet, or whiteboard.
* How to implement: Once a month, write down all devices, apps, and accounts. Highlight those you no longer use and consider deleting or securing them.

## Weeding out weak stems

*(Password Garden)*

* What it is: A rotation and strengthening of your passwords, using password generators, memorable passphrases, or a password manager.
* Why it matters: Weak passwords are like fragile seedlings—they break under the first strong gust. Regular pruning keeps them strong.
* Props: Dice, index cards, or a password manager.
* How to implement: Pick a few accounts each week to update with strong, unique passphrases. Store them safely and encourage household members to do the same.

## Tidying the greenhouse to prevent pests

*(Digital Declutter Day)*

* What it is: A monthly tidy-up of your digital garden: deleting old files, unused apps, and expired accounts. Clear cookies, cache, and browser history.
* Why it matters: Cluttered soil attracts pests; unmonitored data can be harvested by trackers.
* Props: Computer, smartphone, external storage for backups.
* How to implement: Schedule a specific day to review each device, remove unnecessary data, and tidy up account settings.

## Checking the fences and gates

*(Network Visibility Check)*

* What it is: Reviewing which devices are connected to your home network and what they are sharing. Change default passwords and disable unused features.
* Why it matters: A greenhouse with unlocked gates invites intruders. Secure the network to protect your plants (data).
* Props: Router interface, network scanner apps.
* How to implement: Check your router interface weekly or monthly. Disconnect unfamiliar devices and adjust network settings.

## Installing shutters to block prying eyes

*(Encrypted Communication Routine)*

* What it is: Use secure messaging apps or email encryption for personal correspondence. Teach household members the basics of verification and metadata awareness.
* Why it matters: Privacy shutters keep prying eyes out while letting sunlight in. Protect your conversations.
* Props: Smartphone or PC, encrypted messaging apps.
* How to implement: Pick one or two messaging apps that support end-to-end encryption. Encourage verification of keys and avoidance of sharing unnecessary metadata.

## Trimming hidden leaves

*(Metadata Awareness Workshop)*

* What it is: Explore metadata in everyday files: photos, documents, or videos. Remove unnecessary metadata before sharing.
* Why it matters: Metadata is like hidden spores—tiny, invisible, but capable of spreading unexpectedly.
* Props: Smartphone, PC, metadata viewer/editor tools.
* How to implement: Pick files to inspect. Discuss what information could be revealed. Use simple tools to strip unneeded metadata before sharing.

## Adjusting light and water

*(Routine Privacy Settings Check)*

* What it is: A scheduled review of privacy settings across social media, apps, and devices. Document changes.
* Why it matters: Even the healthiest greenhouse can drift out of balance. Check settings regularly to keep your digital plants flourishing.
* Props: Device access, checklist.
* How to implement: Every three months, review all privacy and sharing settings. Adjust as needed and keep a simple log.

## Training the scarecrow

*(Household Data Drill)*

* What it is: Simulate potential intrusions to your home network or accounts. Practice disconnecting devices, checking logs, and responding quickly.
* Why it matters: Like training a scarecrow, rehearsing reactions keeps you ready when pests appear unexpectedly.
* Props: Devices, Wi-Fi network, small tokens for gamification.
* How to implement: Schedule a “data drill” once a quarter. Pretend a device or account has been compromised. Practice isolating it and reviewing your household security posture.
