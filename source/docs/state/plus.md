# FLoC’s demise & its successors

Google officially discontinued FLoC in 2023 after widespread criticism from privacy advocates and regulatory scrutiny. 
However, its core concept—group-based tracking—has evolved into new forms:

Topics API: Google’s replacement for FLoC, which assigns users to broad interest categories (e.g., "fitness" or 
"travel") based on browsing history. While less invasive, it still enables targeted advertising without third-party 
cookies.

Private Advertising Technologies such as Apple’s Private Click Measurement and Meta’s Meta Advantage use on-device 
processing to limit data sharing but retain profiling capabilities.

## Protections

* [Disable Topics API in Chrome or switch to privacy-focused browsers](../pii/chrome.md).
* [Use uBlock Origin and/or Privacy Badger to block tracking scripts](../pii/blocks.md).
