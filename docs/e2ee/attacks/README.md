# Attacks

Most E2EE systems are secure against only the weakest passive adversaries, breakable not by cryptanalysis of underlying 
cryptographic algorithms but by flawed system designs and security assumptions. Unencrypted metadata and access 
patterns make these systems susceptible to inference attacks. And recently made laws seem to have been made to prepare 
the way for agencies to legitimately gather encrypted data via backdoors and ghost protocols.
