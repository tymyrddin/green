# The Great Offshore

Making fireworks go off in the privacy of the reader's brain:

* [ALGOFFSHORE](https://rybn.org/thegreatoffshore/index.php?ln=en&r=2.ALGOFFSHORES) is a series of algorithmic flowcharts that documents various strategies of offshoring and tax optimization.
* [The Sea is Glowing](https://rybn.org/thegreatoffshore/theseaisglowing/) pays attention to the most singular and uncanny incarnations of the offshore phenomenon : Art freeports, Luxembourg space mining futuristic projects, Malta's golden passports programs, seasteading experimental projects and Flags of convenience and the End of Life Flags.
* [The Space Offshore](https://alienocene.com/2022/03/30/the-space-offshore/) dives into the futuristic activities of the offshore industry shed a crude light on the negotiations around space governance that happen today, far away from the public eye.
