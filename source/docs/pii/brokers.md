# How to remove your personal info from data broker websites

Data brokers collect and sell your personal details—like your address, income, and online activity—without your 
permission. Here’s how to take back control and opt out of these sites.

## Step 1: Find where your data is listed

Start by checking where your information appears online. Websites like [Have I Been Pwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) 
show if your email was leaked in data breaches, while Spokeo in the US and similar people-search sites often list 
your home address, phone number, and more. Search your name, email, and phone number to see what’s out there.

EU laws prohibit Spokeo-style scraping of addresses, social media, etc. Services like BlockSurvey or ProtonMail 
(Switzerland) emphasize user control over data, and most EU tools focus on consent-based data access or 
professional use.

## Step 2: Manually opt out of each broker

Once you have found data brokers holding your info, visit each site and look for their “Opt Out” or “Privacy” page 
(usually in the footer). You will probably need to:

* Provide proof of identity, like a photo ID with sensitive details (e.g., ID number) blacked out.
* Fill out a form or send an email requesting removal.

Keep in mind that many brokers re-add your data after a few months, so you’ll need to repeat this process every 3-6 
months to stay off their lists.

If you live in Europe or the UK, the GDPR gives you the right to demand companies delete your data. You can send a 
formal request like this:

```text
Subject: Data Erasure Request Under Article 17 GDPR  
Dear [Company Name],  
I request immediate deletion of all my personal data under Article 17 of the GDPR. This includes any profiles, records, or associated information held by your organisation.  
Please confirm once this action is completed.  
Sincerely,  
[Your Name] 
```

Companies must comply within 30 days or face penalties.

## Step 3: Use automated services for faster removal

If manually opting out feels overwhelming, paid services like DeleteMe (£99/year) handle the process for you, 
regularly scanning and removing your data. For a free alternative, [SimpleOptOut](https://simpleoptout.com/) provides 
step-by-step guides for opting out of 100+ data brokers on your own.

## Staying private long-term

Since data brokers constantly refresh their databases, consider setting a yearly reminder to check for your info and 
resubmit opt-outs. Using a separate email alias for online accounts can also help limit how much they can track.

By following these steps, you’ll significantly reduce how much of your personal data is bought and sold without your 
knowledge.
