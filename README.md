# Threat models

Bottom-up and top-down, with intent to create human-readable threat modelling examples. A work in progress.
And an exercise in using docsify: https://tymyrddin.github.io/threat-models

* [De-Anonymisation threat modelling](docs/da/), an example of using attacker-based threat modelling with a quite non-trivial adversary, namely an entire ecosystem of players and an often forgotten target, the individual citizen. (Attacker-centric)
* [Search Engine threat modelling](docs/se/), an example of organising thoughts and connections of two targets, search engines and their users. (Attacker-centric)
* [E2EE Messaging threat modelling](docs/e2ee/) on that most E2EE systems are secure against only the weakest passive adversaries, yet breakable not by cryptanalysis of underlying cryptographic algorithms but by flawed system designs and security assumptions. (Attacker-centric)

## Mind
Where you stand depends on where you sit, and all threats are cross-vector threats. Without a clear mandate for testing, measuring and reporting actual improvements in security, attempts at improving security makes absolutely no sense, not even for the low-hanging fruit.
