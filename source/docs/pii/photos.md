# Stop tracking and sharing personal info via photos

If you're sharing sensitive files, it's always worth taking a moment to remove this hidden information 
first. These simple steps can help protect your privacy when sending files to others.

## Android users

Android users can enable "Remove location data" in their camera settings to prevent photos from storing GPS 
coordinates. 

Download the "Scrambled Exif" app from the Play Store. Use it to clean photos before sharing them.

## iPhone users

iPhone owners can go to **Settings → Privacy → Location Services** and turn off location access for the 
Camera app, ensuring photos do not secretly record where they were taken.

Share your photos through the Notes app first. When you send them from there, iOS automatically removes the hidden data.
