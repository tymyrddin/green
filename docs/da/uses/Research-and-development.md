# Research & development

Data technologies can be used to comb through enormous volumes of text-based data to assist in research and development. Built upon statistical analysis, artificial intelligence, and machine learning technologies, data mining can analyse massive amounts of data and provide useful and interesting information (trends) about patterns and relationships that exist within the data that might otherwise be missed.

For example, the shift toward evidence-based practice and outcomes research presents significant opportunities and challenges to extract meaningful information from massive amounts of, for example, clinical data to transform it into the best available knowledge to guide nursing practice and for active interdisciplinary collaboration and research.
