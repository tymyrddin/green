# De-Anonymization threat model

Using attacker-based threat modelling with a quite non-trivial adversary, namely an entire eco-system of players and an often forgotten target, the individual citizen. (Attacker-centric)
De-anonymisation is a strategy in data mining in which anonymous data is cross-referenced with other sources of data to re-identify the anonymous data source. Besides being used by those that do not have users' best interest in mind, de-anonymisation also works to further help improve anonymisation techniques and reduce privacy breach by probing the potential drawbacks of anonymisation techniques.
