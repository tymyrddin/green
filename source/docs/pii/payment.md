# Using cash and privacy-focused payment methods

When you make purchases with regular debit/credit cards or mobile payments, companies can track exactly what you buy, 
where, and when. This creates a detailed spending profile that can be used for advertising, credit scoring, or even 
sold to data brokers. Here's how to maintain better financial privacy:

## Why cash still matters in a digital world

Paying with physical banknotes remains the most private way to purchase goods and services because:

* It leaves no digital transaction record that can be tracked
* Does not reveal your identity to the seller
* Can not be linked to other purchases you have made

For maximum privacy with cash:

* Withdraw money from money machines in varying amounts at irregular times
* Consider using different bank branches if making large withdrawals
* Businesses can refuse cash payments over a certain limit for some transactions

## Privacy-enhanced payment cards

When cash is not practical, these alternatives offer more protection than standard cards:

### Prepaid cards with minimal verification

Prepaid cards are available worldwide, but verification rules vary. 

* Purchase with cash. Look for cards requiring only basic registration.
* Use different cards for different spending categories

### Disposable virtual cards

Virtual cards like Revolut work in UK/Europe. Privacy.com is US-only.

* Services like Revolut or Privacy.com generate one-time card numbers
* Each merchant gets a unique number that can not track other purchases
* Set spending limits and expiration dates for extra control

### Cryptocurrency cards 

Cryptocurrency cards have tax implications which differ by country. Examples: BitPay, Crypto.com cards.

* Some services convert crypto to fiat at point of sale
* Doesn't directly link to your bank account

## Special cases for sensitive purchases

For medical, political, or personal items you would rather keep private:

* Use prepaid cards purchased with cash for online orders
* Consider collecting packages from locker services rather than home
* Be aware some merchants share purchase data with third parties regardless of payment method

## The privacy trade-offs

While these methods improve privacy, consider:

* Prepaid cards often have fees and lower spending limits
* Some services may still require ID verification
* Returns/exchanges can be more difficult without purchase records
* Most countries have regulations requiring reporting suspicious cash transactions over â‚¬10,000

Complete financial privacy is challenging in modern banking systems, but these steps can significantly reduce how 
much of your spending habits are recorded and shared. For everyday purchases, alternating between cash and privacy 
cards makes it harder to build a complete profile of your activities.
