Green Team
=========================================

The green team focuses on the larger environment, both technical and human, on documenting what happens and
understanding the unseen logic of the forest, bottom-up and top-down, with intent of creating human-readable
threat modelling, for providing people with choices.

These are some writeups made on our journeys in a digital landscape formed by nature's own
processes and humanoid activities and neglect throughout decades.
