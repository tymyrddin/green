# Removing metadata from files

On Windows, you can remove metadata by right-clicking the file, selecting **Properties**, and then clicking **Remove 
Metadata** (or **Details → Remove Properties**). This deletes hidden details like timestamps and author information.

Mac users can open the file in **Preview**, go to **Tools → Show Inspector**, and delete EXIF data, which often 
includes location and camera settings.

If you need to clean multiple files at once, you can use a tool like [ExifTool](exiftool.md).

Before sharing sensitive files, consider converting them to PDF using LibreOffice, as this process removes most 
hidden data. Another simple trick is to take a screenshot instead of sharing the original file—this creates a 
fresh copy without old metadata.
