The garden layout: Threat model
===================================

In a greenhouse, everything is visible — even what you'd rather keep in the compost bin. This model isn't about
locking every door or fearing every shadow. It's about understanding who might be poking around the potting shed,
what they're after, and how they might get it.

We take an attacker’s-eye view of the terrain — the assets ripe for the picking, the paths through the undergrowth,
the tools in the intruder's kit, and the consequences when the soil turns sour.

Think of it less like a firewall and more like a garden fence with good signage, strong posts, and fewer places
for things to burrow in unnoticed.
