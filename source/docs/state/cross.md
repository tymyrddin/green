# Cross-app & cross-device tracking

Threat:

Mobile ad IDs (MAIDs) and device fingerprinting link activity across apps and devices. A 2025 study found 73% of 
apps share data with 5 or more third parties.

IoT devices (smart TVs, wearables) leak behavioural data (e.g., sleep patterns, voice recordings).

## Protections

* [Reset advertising IDs weekly (Android/iOS settings)](../pii/adids.md).
* [Segment IoT devices on a separate network (e.g., guest Wi-Fi)](../pii/vlan.md).
