# Attack vectors

An attack vector is a method of gaining unauthorized access to a network or computer system. An attack surface is the 
total number of attack vectors an attacker can use to manipulate a network or computer system or extract data.

There are many ways to expose, alter, disable, destroy, steal or gain unauthorized access to computer systems, 
infrastructure, networks, operating systems and vulnerable endpoints (including IoT devices).
