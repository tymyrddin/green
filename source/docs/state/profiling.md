# AI-powered behavioural profiling

Advertisers and data brokers now use AI to correlate offline behaviour (e.g., credit card purchases, location pings) 
with online activity, creating "super-profiles". As an example, retailers predict pregnancy status from shopping 
patterns, even before public announcements.

## Protections

* [Opt out of data broker lists](../pii/brokers.md) (e.g., DeleteMe, SimpleOptOut).
* [Use cash or privacy-focused cards](../pii/payment.md) (e.g., Monero-based payments).
